PyGeneses is a deep reinforcement learning framework for evolution simulation environments. PyGeneses provides a high level API for training agents using standard Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in environments with in-built neural networks for performing policy evaluation. Users can thus focus on the main problem - to observe interesting patterns amongst these artificial species in various simulated environments.

## Prima vita

Prima vita is a species of artificially simulated beings created as part of Project DC. This repository holds a simulation environment created in pygame which is to be used with Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to find out the evolution of Prima Vita.

## Installation

Pygeneses can be installed using pip:-

```bash
user@programmer~:$ pip install git+https://github.com/Project-DC/pygeneses
